Time spent: 4 hours.

## Work Completed

I certify that I completed all steps in the lab using my own computer. 

**Part 3:** The requirement for around up, is If the difference between grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5. Also, the score has to bigger or to equal than 38. ( if(score >= 38 {}) ) And, the inside of if statement when I first attempt I used (score % 5 => 3), so if the remainder bigger than 3, it will around up. However, I didn't make it work. So, I used a long way like what I did in the Grader.java.  

## Known Issues

* The code in Grader.java definitely could be simplified. Rather than that, I think all my programs are working. 

## Transcripts

For Hello.java 
```
C:\Users\Joshua\Desktop\Java\Lab\Lab1\Hello\Hello
First number:
77
Second number:
23
The sum is 100
```


For Guess.java:
```
C:\Users\Joshua\Desktop\Java\Lab\Lab1\Guess\Guess
Enter your guess: 
10
Your guess is too high.
Enter your guess: 
5
Your guess is too high.
Enter your guess: 
2
Your guess is too high.
Enter your guess: 
1
You got it!!
It took you 4 guesses.
